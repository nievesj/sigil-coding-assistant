## Symptom

When the agent runs `git_commit` (or `git_log` /
`git_show` with the "follow agent files" toggle on), the VCS Log tool window opens and:

1. A small red bubble appears: **"Commit `<hash>` could not be found"**.
2. The wrong commit is highlighted in the log — typically the
   *previous* HEAD (the parent of the commit we just created), or, in multi-repo projects, an unrelated commit from a
   different repository.

The new commit is still made and visible at the top of the log when you scroll there manually, so the bug is
*cosmetic* rather than data-corrupting — but it makes the
"Follow Agent Files" mode feel broken every time the agent commits.

### Reproduction

1. Enable **Follow Agent Files** in the AgentBridge tool window settings.
2. Have the agent run `git_commit` (or `git_log`, `git_show`).
3. Observe the VCS Log open. The bubble appears in the bottom-right; the highlighted commit is
   *not* the one just created.

In a multi-repo project the symptom is even more obvious — the wrong-repo case selects a commit from a sibling
repository.

## Architecture

```
GitCommitTool.execute()
    ↓ (after successful commit, with the resolved repo root)
GitTool.showNewCommitInLog(repoRoot)
    ↓ pooled thread: runGitIn(repoRoot, "rev-parse", "HEAD")
    ↓ EDT:
    └─ PlatformApiCompat.showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh(project, fullHash, repoRoot, openVcsTwCallback)
        ↓
        ┌─ Snapshot current VcsLogGraphData (the "initial pack")
        ├─ Register DataPackChangeListener
        ├─ VcsLogData.refresh(List.of(repoRootVf))    ← refreshes the COMMIT'S repo, not project base
        ├─ On every DataPack event, check both:
        │     1. New VcsLogGraphData != initial   (a fresh pack was published)
        │     2. isCommitIndexed(data, hash, root) (storage has the hash)
        └─ When BOTH are true → navigateToRevisionInMainLog(project, root, hash, callback):
              callback.run()                            ← opens VCS tool window (show/activate) HERE
              VcsProjectLog.showRevisionInMainLog(project, root, hash)   ← root-aware overload
```

## Root causes

The bug has had **six** distinct contributing causes. The current fix addresses all six. A regression in any one is
enough to bring the bubble back.

### Cause 1 — Wrong repo root in multi-repo projects

`GitCommitTool` uses `runGitIn(root, ...)` after `resolveRepoRootOrError`. But the follow-along path used
`runGit("rev-parse", "HEAD")`, which routes through
`PlatformApiCompat.getRepository(project)` → resolves to the **project base** repo
(or the first registered repo) — not the one we committed to. So the hash read for navigation belongs to a
*different* repo's HEAD.

**Fix invariant**: `showNewCommitInLog` and `showFirstCommitInLog` always take a
`repoRoot` parameter. The `runGitIn(repoRoot, ...)` call inside must use that root. Likewise
`refresh(List.of(repoRootVf))` must refresh that root, not the project base.

This is the regression introduced by `c92b1231` ("feat: add multi-repo git support")
which added `runGitIn` everywhere else but missed the follow-along path.

### Cause 2 — Storage-vs-DataPack timing race

`VcsLogRefresherImpl` updates `VcsLogStorage` (so `containsCommit(hash, root)` returns true) **before** the new
`PermanentGraph` is rebuilt and a fresh `DataPack` is published.

If we navigate as soon as
`isCommitIndexed` returns true, we hit a window where the storage already knows the hash but the visible graph still
ends at the previous HEAD.
`showRevisionInMainLog` then can't find the commit in the visible model and emits the bubble + selects the previous
HEAD.

**Fix invariant**: the listener must wait for **both**:

1. `isCommitIndexed(data, hash, root)` — storage knows the hash, *and*
2. the compatibility-layer graph identity has changed — a fresh VCS Log graph/data-pack object has been published (so
   the visible graph contains the new commit).

> ⚠️ **Do not directly compare `data.getDataPack() != initialPack`** for the freshness check.
> In newer IDEs, `getDataPack()` is a deprecated wrapper that returns a *new* DataPack
> object on every call — reference comparison is meaningless and the listener never sees a
> real change. `PlatformApiCompat` must use its graph-identity helper instead: reflectively
> call `getGraphData()` when available, fall back to `getDataPack()` only for older SDKs
> where `getGraphData()` does not exist, and prefer the `DataPackChangeListener` event
> payload when the listener fires.

### Cause 3 — Wrong `showRevisionInMainLog` overload

`VcsProjectLog.showRevisionInMainLog(project, hash)` is the project-wide overload. In multi-repo projects with the same
hash present in multiple roots (e.g. submodules, worktrees, identical empty trees) it can resolve to the wrong root.

**Fix invariant**: always use the root-aware overload
`showRevisionInMainLog(project, root, hash)` whenever a root is known. The chat-chip click handler (
`ChatConsolePanel.kt:1795,1815`) doesn't know the root — it falls back to the 2-arg back-compat shim which uses the
project-wide overload. That fallback is acceptable because chat-chip clicks operate on abbreviated hashes that were
already resolved against the project base.

### Cause 4 — Focus guard skipped the actual navigation

The focus-stealing fix correctly changed the tool-window opening path to call
`tw.show()` instead of `tw.activate(null)` while chat is active. A later implementation also returned early before
`showRevisionInMainLog` when chat was active. That avoided focus steal, but it also meant follow-mode never selected the
new commit in the VCS Log while the user was using chat — the normal commit path.

**Fix invariant**: use `isChatToolWindowActive(project)` only to choose `tw.show()` vs
`tw.activate(null)` when opening the VCS tool window. Once a fresh graph contains the commit in the target root, always
call
`showRevisionInMainLog(project, root, hash)`.

### Cause 5 — VCS tool window activated before graph refresh (IntelliJ 2025.3 regression)

In IntelliJ 2025.3,
`tw.activate(null)` on the VCS tool window triggers a "highlight current revision" behavior: the log immediately
attempts to navigate to the current HEAD. If
`tw.activate(null)` fires before the VCS log graph has been rebuilt (i.e. in the window after `git commit` but before
`DataPackChangeListener` fires), HEAD is the new commit but it is not yet in the visible
`PermanentGraph` → "commit not found" bubble.

The previous implementation called `tw.activate(null)` at the top of the `showNewCommitInLog`
invokeLater — before
`showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh` and its listener ran. This was safe in earlier IntelliJ versions that did not
auto-navigate on activation, but regressed in 2025.3.

**Fix invariant**: the VCS tool window `activate`/`show` call must happen inside
`navigateToRevisionInMainLog`, immediately before `showRevisionInMainLog` — i.e. only after the
`DataPackChangeListener` (or the race-condition guard) has confirmed the graph is fresh and the commit is indexed.
`showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh` now accepts an optional
`Runnable preNavigationCallback`; `showNewCommitInLog` passes the tool-window open/show logic as that callback.

### Cause 6 — Premature `tw.activate` before commit completes (sonar refactoring regression)

The sonar refactoring commit `9a07ecd67c` (May 1) extracted a `showVcsToolWindow()` helper method in `GitCommitTool` and
called it at line 92 — **before** `runGitIn(root, commitCommandArgs...)` at line 93. Because `showVcsToolWindow()` posts
`invokeLater(tw.activate(null))`, the EDT can process that activation after the blocking `runGitIn` call completes (i.e.
after the commit exists in git). At that point HEAD is the new commit, but the VCS log graph has not yet been refreshed.
IntelliJ 2025.3's "highlight current revision" behavior fires on `tw.activate(null)`, tries to navigate to the new HEAD,
finds it missing in the stale graph → "commit not found" bubble.

This is a timing race: if the EDT processes the activation BEFORE `runGitIn` completes, HEAD is still the old commit
(safely present in the graph, no bubble). Under load the activation fires AFTER the commit, HEAD is new, graph is stale.

**Fix invariant**: `GitCommitTool.execute()` must never call `tw.activate(null)` or any `showVcsToolWindow()` helper
directly. The VCS tool window is opened exclusively by the `openVcsTw` callback passed to `showNewCommitInLog()`, which
fires only after the `DataPackChangeListener` confirms the graph contains the new commit. Refactoring helpers that call
`tw.activate` are safe to add only inside that callback.

## Interaction with `FOCUS-STEALING-BUG.md`

The two bugs pull in **opposite directions**:

- The focus bug requires the follow-along path to *not* steal focus from the chat input. The mitigation is the
  `isChatToolWindowActive(project)` guard *inside* the tool-window `invokeLater` lambda — it must run on the EDT *just
  before* choosing
  `tw.show()` vs `tw.activate(...)`, because the active tool window can change between scheduling and execution.

- This bug requires the follow-along path to *actually
  navigate* to the new commit. Tightening the focus guard too far (e.g. skipping navigation entirely whenever the chat
  is active) reintroduces this bug — the user enables "Follow Agent Files"
  precisely so the log *does* navigate.

**The contract** between the two bugs:

- When the chat tool window is **active**: call `tw.show()` (does not steal focus)
  but still navigate the visible log selection. Navigation is silent for the user unless they manually open the VCS Log
  tab.
- When the chat tool window is **not active**: call
  `tw.activate(null)` (full activation is fine because the user isn't focused on chat) and navigate.
- In **both** cases, navigate via `showRevisionInMainLog` so the bubble doesn't appear and the right commit is selected.

A change in either file that breaks one of those rules will reintroduce one of the two bugs.

## Pre-merge checklist

Before merging *any* change to the files listed above, manually verify:

- [ ] `GitTool.showNewCommitInLog(String)` and `showFirstCommitInLog(String, String)`
  both take a `repoRoot` parameter and use `runGitIn(repoRoot, ...)`.
- [ ] All callers (`GitCommitTool`, `GitLogTool`, `GitShowTool`) pass the resolved
  `root` from `resolveRepoRootOrError` — *not* `getProject().getBasePath()`.
- [ ] `GitCommitTool.execute()` calls `showNewCommitInLog(root)` **after** the
  `if (result.startsWith("Error")) return result;` check. Calling it before opens the log on a failed commit and looks
  identical to this bug.
- [ ] 
  `PlatformApiCompat.showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh` snapshots the current graph identity through the compatibility
  helper —
  **not** a direct `data.getDataPack()`
  wrapper comparison.
- [ ] The DataPackChangeListener navigation predicate requires both a changed graph identity AND
  `isCommitIndexed(data, hash, root)` for the *target* root, not any root.
- [ ] The `refresh(...)` call passes the *commit's repo root* as a `VirtualFile`, not the project base.
- [ ] `VcsProjectLog.showRevisionInMainLog` is called with the 3-arg
  `(project, root, hash)` overload whenever a root is known.
- [ ] `isChatToolWindowActive(project)` is checked *inside* the pre-navigation callback passed to
  `showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh`, right before choosing `tw.show()` vs
  `tw.activate(null)`. The callback runs inside
  `navigateToRevisionInMainLog` — after graph freshness is confirmed — not before
  `showRevisionInLogAfterRefresh` is called. It must not guard or skip
  `showRevisionInMainLog`; skipping navigation reintroduces this bug.
- [ ] The regression test
  `GitCommitFollowAlongRepoRootTest.testShowNewCommitInLogReadsHeadFromSuppliedRoot`
  still passes.
- [ ] Manual smoke test: with Follow Agent Files **on
  **, ask the agent to make a commit; verify the VCS Log opens, no bubble appears, and the topmost commit is selected.
  Repeat in a multi-repo project (e.g. add a submodule or sibling repo)
  and verify selection happens in the *correct* repo.
- [ ] `GitCommitTool.execute()` does NOT call `tw.activate(null)` or any helper that calls it directly. The only
  VCS tool window opener is the `openVcsTw` lambda inside `showNewCommitInLog()` (called after graph is confirmed fresh).
  Grep for `showVcsToolWindow\|tw\.activate` in `GitCommitTool.java` before merging.

## Debugging when the bug returns

If the bubble reappears after a future change, in order:

1. **Did the changed code remove a `repoRoot` parameter or a `runGitIn` call?**
   That's Cause 1 — multi-repo regression. Revert and route the root through.

2. **Is `data.getDataPack()` being compared directly to a snapshot somewhere?**
   That's the Cause 2 trap on newer SDKs — the comparison always returns "different". Route freshness checks through
   `PlatformApiCompat`'s graph-identity helper instead.

3. **Is `showRevisionInMainLog(project, hash)` being called with no root?**
   That's Cause 3 — switch to the 3-arg overload (`project, root, hash`).

4. **Did `getDetectedGitRoots` start returning roots that aren't in
   `data.getLogProviders()`?** This happens for unregistered subfolder repos
   (e.g. submodules the user hasn't added to project settings). Skip navigation cleanly when
   `getLogProviders().get(root) == null` — don't blow up, don't navigate to a stale root.

5. **Does the focus guard return before `showRevisionInMainLog`?** That is Cause 4. Cross-check [
   `FOCUS-STEALING-BUG.md`](FOCUS-STEALING-BUG.md): the guard belongs on VCS tool-window show/activate, not on the
   log-selection navigation.

6. **Is `GitCommitTool.execute()` calling `tw.activate(null)` or any `showVcsToolWindow()` helper directly?** That is Cause 6.
   The VCS tool window must only be opened via the `openVcsTw` callback inside `showNewCommitInLog()` — which fires only after
   the `DataPackChangeListener` confirms the graph is fresh. Any direct `tw.activate()` call before that confirmation point
   is a race that triggers IntelliJ 2025.3's "highlight current revision" on a stale graph. The sonar refactoring `9a07ecd67c`
   reintroduced this as a separate `showVcsToolWindow()` method called even before `runGitIn(commit)` completed.
